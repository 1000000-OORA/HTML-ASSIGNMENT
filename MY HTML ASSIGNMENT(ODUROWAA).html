		<p style="color: navy;" >My name is Oduro Raphaelina Odurowaa. I am 19 years old and I have 3 sisters. I like to eat good food and I like watching Kdramas and listening to kpop.I'm offering computer engineering because I have some interest in what makes up a computer to make it work and also I like a bit of software(not too much though) as well so a blend between the two made me interested in it.
